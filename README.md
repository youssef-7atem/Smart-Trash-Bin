# Smart-Trash-Bin
This project aimed to modernize waste recycling for smart cities. The trash bin uses a camera for machine vision to  detect and categorize different types of waste. Ultrasonic sensors detect motion, allowing the bin to open automatically  , the bin features a GPS tracker that signals when the bin is full, sending notifications  to an app.
